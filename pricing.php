                        <p>Thank you for choosing Typecase, and we appreciate your business. The approved forms of payment
                        regulations of Typecase are detailed in this section.</p>
                        <p>Typecase only accepts payments through credit cards, debit cards, and net banking. The Reserve Bank of
                        India has mandated that all transactions have an additional layer of authentication starting on August 1,
                        2010, to make online purchasing safer. Other methods will be added when they become available, and we
                        will update the same here. </p>
                        <p>Your credit or debit card details are kept secret and secure. Your Card information is safeguarded by
                        Secure Sockets Layer security technology, which Typecase and our safe online payment gateways use.

                        We only support Indian VISA and MasterCards, while international cards are not supported. To complete
                        the payment, you must enter your 16-digit credit or debit card number and the three-digit CVV (Card
                        Verification Value) code on the back of your debit or credit card.

                        Additionally, you can order the product and pay with your wallet or UPI ID.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="title3 text-black">Pricing Policy </h4>
                        <p>The Typecase management decides the prices of the products enlisted on the site, and you can make the
                        payment for the products via debit card, credit card, or net banking. The prices listed on the website are
                        final, and there will be no changes in the prices of the product unless the management decides.
