            <p>The Typecase Store's standard product warranty, which Typecase India provides, will cover all Typecase materials, goods (including but not limited to software), and services that are included on or otherwise made available to you through it. The warranty period offered by us on all products is 1 year. The products are offered "as is" and "as available" without any representations or implied guarantees unless otherwise stated in writing. You are urged to conduct your research before placing your order for the products since nothing on this website should be construed as, or is intended to be construed as, advice of any sort. The consumer should get in touch with the Typecase team online if they discover any manufacturing flaws while the Warranty still covers the product. We offer a 7-day return policy to customers who receive damaged products on condition that they have a copy of the bill with them.</p>
